# Oracle known false positives — triage of the 2026-06-27 five-repo run

Companion to [`oracle.md`](oracle.md). On 2026-06-27 the cross-tool oracle ran
over five top-200-NuGet, general-purpose libraries — **Newtonsoft.Json,
CsvHelper, serilog, NLog, protobuf-net** — diffing Own.NET against Infer# and
CodeQL. This note records the triage of every **own-only** finding against the
target's real source, so the verdicts are durable and the [FP
baseline](../../corpus/oracle-fp-baseline.txt) that suppresses them on re-runs is
auditable.

Headline: across all five repos, **0 own-only findings came from the new
owned-API recognition** (ADO `ExecuteReader`/`CreateCommand`, Xml/Json
`.Create`/`.Parse`, Socket `Accept`) — those libraries don't use those APIs in a
leaking shape, so the recognition extensions added **no noise on third-party
code**. Every own-only finding is a disposable-field or event-subscription
catch — Own.NET's differentiating niche, which the oracles' leak queries (local
not-disposed) structurally cannot express. `Agree = 0` on all five for the same
reason: we and the oracles occupy orthogonal niches.

## Disposition summary

20 own-only findings, triaged to ground truth:

| disposition | count | what happens on re-run |
|---|---:|---|
| **Fixed in the extractor** | 7 | no longer fire (5 NLog `WaitForDispose` timers + protobuf `XsltOptions` self-cycle + Newtonsoft `serializer.Error` returned-fresh provenance, #146 — see below) |
| **Baselined FP** | 4 | moved to "Known FP (baselined)", out of the triage queue |
| **Non-product (path filter)** | 2 | dropped by `--exclude-tests` (`unittest` rule) |
| **True positive — kept visible** | 4 | stays in "Own.NET only" (real catch, oracle can't express) |
| **True-but-benign — kept, baselined-as-sample** | 3 | (protobuf `assorted/` samples) baselined as non-product |

(Re-triage 2026-06-28: `Page.xaml.cs` `timer` moved from "Baselined FP" 6→5 to
"True-but-benign sample" 2→3 — it is a real leak of a custom `IDisposable`
`Nuxleus.Performance.Stopwatch`, not the BCL non-disposable type first assumed.)

The 4 baselined FPs + the 3 non-product-sample reals = 7 findings, covered by
**6 rules** in `corpus/oracle-fp-baseline.txt` (the two `NetTranscoder` copies
share one basename-keyed rule; the Newtonsoft `serializer.Error` rule was removed
when #146 fixed it at the source); the 2 test-base findings are the
`--exclude-tests` drops; the 4 true positives are deliberately **not** suppressed.

**Update (extractor fix landed — protobuf self-cycle).** `CommandLineOptions.XsltOptions.
XsltMessageEncountered` — a `this`-capturing handler subscribed to an event on
`XsltOptions`, a get-only property over a constructed field the class owns — is now
**fixed at the source** by `PropertyReturnsOwnedMember` (the self-owned-source exemption
now covers a property receiver, not just `this`/fields/locals). A live protobuf re-run
confirmed it: own-only **0**, the finding absent from own-only and baselined. See
root-cause #3. Corpus fixture: `subscription-self-owned-property`.

**Update (#146 landed).** Newtonsoft's `serializer.Error` is now **fixed at the
source** too: the extractor's compilation-wide returned-fresh publisher provenance
pass proves the `Create` → `ApplySerializerSettings` shape bounded
(`source_provenance: "returned_fresh"`) and the bridge drops it. Its baseline
entry is removed (deliberately — a regression must reappear in triage, not be
swallowed by the allowlist). Pinned by
`frontend/roslyn/samples/ReturnedPublisherSample.cs`; denial cases (public
candidate, mixed callers, field-stored local, param→param DI forwarding, and the
two local-function closure captures — callee-side `ProvLocalFuncFactory` and
caller-side `ProvCallerLocalFuncFactory`) keep the honest warning.

**Update (extractor fix landed — all NLog timers).** All 5 of the original NLog
`WaitForDispose` timer FPs are now **fixed at the source**, baseline entries deleted.
Four (`AsyncTaskTarget._taskTimeoutTimer`/`_lazyWriterTimer`,
`AsyncTargetWrapper._lazyWriterTimer`, `BufferingTargetWrapper._flushTimer`) by
`CallReleasesReceiver` — a live NLog re-run confirmed own-only leak total **8 → 4**.
The fifth, `TimeoutContinuation._timeoutTimer` (disposed through the
`Interlocked.Exchange(ref _timer, null)` result), by `RefExchangeNulledField`, which
binds the exchange result to the field so the sink call is seen as a release
(own-only **4 → 3**, NLog baseline now empty). See root-cause #1. Corpus fixtures:
`field-dispose-via-helper`, `field-dispose-via-exchange`.

## Per-finding verdicts

### NLog/NLog — 8 findings (disposable fields)

| field / class | verdict | why |
|---|---|---|
| `_timeoutTimer` / TimeoutContinuation | **FP → baseline** | `Dispose()` → `StopTimer()` → `Timer.WaitForDispose()` on the `Interlocked.Exchange(ref _timer, null)` result (ref-alias, out of fix scope) |
| `_taskTimeoutTimer` / AsyncTaskTarget | **FP → fixed** | `Dispose(bool disposing)` → `Timer.WaitForDispose()` (direct field receiver) |
| `_lazyWriterTimer` / AsyncTaskTarget | **FP → fixed** | `Dispose(bool disposing)` → `Timer.WaitForDispose()` (direct field receiver) |
| `_lazyWriterTimer` / AsyncTargetWrapper | **FP → fixed** | `CloseTarget()` → `StopLazyWriterThread()` → `Timer.WaitForDispose()` (simple alias) |
| `_flushTimer` / BufferingTargetWrapper | **FP → fixed** | `CloseTarget()` → `Timer.WaitForDispose()` (simple alias) |
| `_xmlSource` / XmlParser | **true positive → keep** | never disposed (benign: a `CharEnumerator` over a `StringReader` over a string — no unmanaged resource) |
| `_reusableFileWriteStream` / FileTarget | **true positive → keep** | never disposed (benign: `ReusableStreamCreator` over a `MemoryStream` — managed memory only) |
| `_reusableBatchFileWriteStream` / FileTarget | **true positive → keep** | never disposed (same) |

`WaitForDispose(this Timer, TimeSpan)` (NLog `Common/AsyncHelpers.cs`) really does
dispose the timer (`Change(Infinite,Infinite)` then `Dispose()`). All five timer
FPs route disposal through it, on a **local alias** of the field
(`Interlocked.Exchange(ref _timer, null)` / `var t = _timer`), inside either a
`Dispose(bool disposing)` override or a `CloseTarget()` lifecycle hook. The
extractor's field-disposal scan only inspects the **top-level statements of the
parameterless `Dispose()`** for a direct `field.Dispose()` — so it sees none of
this.

### protobuf-net/protobuf-net — 7 findings

| location | verdict | why |
|---|---|---|
| `src/protobuf-net.Core/ProtoWriter.BufferWriter.cs` `_nullWriter` | **FP → baseline** | intentional null-object kept attached for pooled reuse; `Dispose()` comments *"don't cascade dispose to the null one"* |
| `assorted/.../ProtoTranscoder.cs` `sync` (×2 copies) | **true-but-benign → baseline (non-product sample)** | `NetTranscoder` isn't `IDisposable`; one `ReaderWriterLockSlim` for app lifetime in a sample/extension tree |
| `assorted/ProtoGen/CommandLineOptions.cs` `XsltMessageEncountered` | **FP → baseline** | self-subscription: publisher (`xsltOptions`) and the lambda are both owned by the same `CommandLineOptions`, co-lifetimed |
| `assorted/SilverlightExtended/Page.xaml.cs` `timer` | **true-but-non-product → baseline (re-triaged 2026-06-28)** | TRUE POSITIVE: `timer` is a custom `IDisposable` `Nuxleus.Performance.Stopwatch` (NOT `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch`) never disposed — the disposing `using (timer)` is commented out. Correctly flagged; baselined as non-product sample. |
| `src/BuildToolsUnitTests/AnalyzerTestBase.cs` `logging.Log` | **test noise → path filter** | xUnit fixture; per-test lifetime |
| `src/BuildToolsUnitTests/GeneratorTestBase.cs` `logging.Log` | **test noise → path filter** | xUnit fixture; per-test lifetime |

The two `BuildToolsUnitTests` findings are now dropped by `--exclude-tests`: that
camelCase project name is one dot-less path segment, which the exact dot-component
guards missed, so `_is_test_path` gained a safe `unittest` substring rule.

### serilog/serilog — 1 finding

| location | verdict | why |
|---|---|---|
| `BatchingSink.cs` `_shutdownSignal` (CancellationTokenSource) | **true positive → keep** | `Dispose()` *and* `DisposeAsync()` only call `_shutdownSignal.Cancel()`, never `Dispose()` — a genuine (if benign) undisposed CTS |

Not an async-dispose-tracing miss: the CTS is disposed in **neither** path. This
is a real catch the oracles' local-not-disposed query can't express, and it stays
visible.

### JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json — 2 findings

| location | verdict | why |
|---|---|---|
| `TraceJsonReader.cs` `_textWriter` | **FP → baseline** | no-op dispose: a `JsonTextWriter` over an in-memory `StringWriter`/`StringBuilder` holds no unmanaged resource |
| `JsonSerializer.cs` `serializer.Error` | **FP → fixed (#146)** | intra-call self-subscription: the serializer is freshly built from the same `JsonSerializerSettings` whose `.Error` it subscribes; co-lifetimed. Now proven bounded by the returned-fresh publisher provenance pass; baseline entry removed |

### JoshClose/CsvHelper — 2 findings

| location | verdict | why |
|---|---|---|
| `docs-src/.../ConsoleHost.cs` `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.ProcessExit` | **FP → baseline** | process-lived subscriber (a docs-generator host) to a process-lived event source — promoting it to that lifetime is vacuous |
| `docs-src/.../ConsoleHost.cs` `Console.CancelKeyPress` | **FP → baseline** | same |

## Root-cause categories and the fix that would retire each baseline

The baselined FPs cluster into four analyzer limitations. Each baseline entry is a
standing request for the corresponding capability — when it lands, retire the
entry and let the oracle re-confirm clean.

1. **Custom dispose-sink — MOSTLY FIXED** *(was 5 NLog timers; 4 now cleared, 1
   remains).* The disposal scan already covers the whole class (so
   `Dispose(bool disposing)`, `CloseTarget()`, helper methods, simple `var t = _f;`
   aliases, and null-conditional `_f?.Dispose()` were all already handled) — the one
   gap was the disposing-method **name**: NLog releases its timers through a custom
   extension `WaitForDispose(this Timer)`, not a literal `.Dispose()`. **Shipped fix:**
   `CallReleasesReceiver` (extractor) credits `field.M(...)` as a release when `M` is a
   first-party extension method whose receiver it disposes — proved by reusing
   `ConsumesParam` on `M`'s reduced receiver parameter (inspects the real body, follows
   first-party forwarding, cycle-guarded, IDisposable-only), never guessed from the
   name. A live NLog re-run confirmed it: own-only 8 → 4, the 4 direct/simple-alias
   timers cleared. The fifth, `TimeoutContinuation._timeoutTimer`, disposes the result
   of `Interlocked.Exchange(ref _timer, null)`; **`RefExchangeNulledField`** now binds
   that exchange result to the field (the idiom atomically nulls the field and returns
   its owned object), so the `current?.WaitForDispose(...)` is seen as a release —
   own-only 4 → 3, the NLog baseline now empty. Restricted to a `null`/`default`
   replacement: an exchange installing a new non-null value re-arms the field and is
   declined (precision-first). **The `using (preExistingLocal)` form is now handled** —
   `var r = new ...; using (r) { ... }`, an already-acquired tracked local, is threaded as
   a scope-exit release in the `--flow-locals` lowering (no `acquire`; only the missing
   release, mirroring the `MemoryPool` owner branch), with sound throw-routing
   (`onThrowDefinite`). Corpus fixtures: `local-dispose-via-using-statement`,
   `using-statement-throw-releases`. **It does NOT clear the protobuf `Page.xaml.cs`
   baseline entry — because that entry is a TRUE POSITIVE, not an FP.** A live protobuf
   oracle run (2026-06-28) + the raw source settled it: `Stopwatch` there is
   `Nuxleus.Performance.Stopwatch` (the file has `using Nuxleus.Performance;` and uses
   `Stopwatch.UnitPrecision` / `timer.Scope = () => …`, NOT `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch`),
   a custom **`IDisposable`** scope-timer that is genuinely never disposed (the disposing
   `using (timer)` block is commented out). The extractor flags it via the flow-locals path,
   which gates on `ImplementsIDisposable` — so it correctly resolved the custom type and
   reported a real leak. It stays baselined as **non-product sample** (assorted/ Silverlight
   demo), like the `NetTranscoder` `sync` entry — not as an FP. (Two earlier readings —
   "missed `using`" and "non-`IDisposable` `Stopwatch` FP" — were both wrong; issue #161 was
   opened on the second and then closed as invalid.) Other custom-sink fixtures:
   `field-dispose-via-helper`, `field-dispose-via-exchange`.

2. **No-op `Dispose` not modelled — PARTLY FIXED** *(Newtonsoft `TraceJsonReader.
   _textWriter`).* We flag any undisposed `IDisposable` structurally, without modelling
   that the concrete `Dispose` releases nothing. **Shipped fix:** `IsNoOpDisposeWrapper`
   extends the existing `StringWriter`/`StringReader` field exemption to BCL **read-only
   pass-through readers** — a `StreamReader`/`BinaryReader` field whose *every* construction
   wraps an in-memory backing (`MemoryStream`/`StringWriter`/`StringReader`) cascades
   disposal only to managed memory, so it is dispose-optional. **Writers** (`StreamWriter`/
   `BinaryWriter`) are excluded: their `Dispose` flushes buffered output, so a never-disposed
   writer can drop data — a real bug the OWN001 keeps flagging (Codex P2). The allowlist is
   closed to those two readers (not "any BCL stream": `GZipStream`/`CryptoStream` own a
   native/extra resource), and a path that builds `new StreamReader(path)` (a real file
   handle) keeps the field flagged. Corpus fixture
   `field-noop-dispose-wrapper`; full rationale
   [`no-op-dispose-wrapper.md`](no-op-dispose-wrapper.md). **Stays baselined — and NOT
   soundly auto-fixable (investigated 2026-06-28):** Newtonsoft's `_textWriter` is a
   `JsonTextWriter` over a `StringWriter`, but reading the real `JsonTextWriter` source shows
   it is **not a no-op type** — `Close()` runs `base.Close()` (auto-completes open JSON
   tokens, writing closing brackets) and `CloseBufferAndWriter()`, which **returns its rented
   `_writeBuffer` to `_arrayPool`** when an `ArrayPool` is set (a real pooled-buffer release,
   the POOL-leak class we track) and closes the writer. So a recursive "Dispose-is-a-no-op"
   recognizer would be **unsound** (it can leak a pooled buffer) or correctly **decline** —
   either way it would not clear this. The instance is benign only by **instance facts** (no
   `ArrayPool` set + the sink is a `StringWriter`), not a type-level no-op — the same reason
   we exclude writers from `IsNoOpDisposeWrapper`. The recursive-analysis idea is therefore
   **shelved as not worth building**, not merely deferred. Note the NLog `_xmlSource` /
   `_reusable*Stream` reals are also third-party wrappers (`CharEnumerator`,
   `ReusableStreamCreator`) of the same benign shape and stay **kept visible** for the
   same reason — we can't prove their disposal is a no-op, so we don't silently drop them.

3. **Lifetime-unaware subscription — PARTLY FIXED** *(was protobuf `XsltOptions`,
   Newtonsoft `serializer.Error`; CsvHelper process-lived host).* OWN014's premise —
   a long-lived source outlives a shorter-lived subscriber — fails when publisher and
   subscriber are **co-lifetimed** or the subscriber is **itself process-lived**.
   **Shipped fix:** `PropertyReturnsOwnedMember` extends the self-owned-source exemption
   to a **property** receiver — `this.OwnedProp.Event += handler`, where `OwnedProp` is a
   get-only property over a member the class constructs, is the same collectable
   self-cycle as the owned field directly (get-only required: a settable property could
   be reassigned to an injected object). Cleared protobuf `XsltOptions` on a live re-run
   (own-only 0); corpus fixture `subscription-self-owned-property`. **Still open:**
   Newtonsoft `serializer.Error` — the source is a returned `Create()` result (escapes)
   and the handler is a parameter's delegate; the source's lifetime relative to the
   handler is genuinely unprovable syntactically, so the "may outlive" warning is honest
   (baselined, not a clear FP). CsvHelper's process-lived host needs a "subscriber is
   itself process-lived" signal — still open. See
   [`subscription-leaks-and-profiles.md`](subscription-leaks-and-profiles.md).

4. **Non-product trees** *(protobuf `assorted/`, CsvHelper `docs-src/`, protobuf
   `BuildToolsUnitTests/`).* Sample/extension/doc-generator code that was never
   meant to be production-clean. The generic `unittest` rule now covers camelCase
   test projects; the remaining repo-specific sample trees (`assorted/`,
   `docs-src/`) are handled per-entry in the baseline rather than by polluting the
   generic `_is_test_path` with repo-specific directory names.

## 2026-07-01 fresh-repo sweep (Dapper, StackExchange.Redis)

A second cross-tool sweep over two general-purpose libraries not in the original
five, to hunt new FP classes / recall gaps.

**DapperLib/Dapper — clean.** 0 own-only findings: the ADO.NET owned-API
recognition added no noise on a heavy 3000-line ADO codebase. Oracle-only was
Infer#'s `WrappedBasicReader` "not closed" (a wrapped reader **returned to the
caller** — the ownership-transfer FP class `oracle.md` already dings Infer# for) and
CodeQL `cs/dispose-not-called-on-throw` inside large `Read`/`NextResult` methods that
`--flow-locals` honestly skips. No product bug, no FP class.

**StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis — two pooled-buffer-transfer FP classes, both
fixed.** A rented `ArrayPool` buffer handed to a wrapper that then escapes was flagged
`OWN001` "rented but never returned", though the wrapper owns the `Return`:

1. `Lease<T>.Create` — `var arr = Rent(length); var lease = new Lease<T>(arr, length);
   return lease;`. The `new Wrapper(buf)` bound to a **local that then leaves the
   method** was not recognised as a transfer (the direct `return new Wrapper(buf)` rule
   is one-level). **Fix:** `WrapperLocalEscapes` — a wrapper local that provably leaves
   (`return w` / `<field> = w` / `w` as a call arg) transfers the buffer; a method-scoped
   wrapper still leaks (Codex's one-level rule preserved). Corpus fixture
   `pool-transfer-via-wrapper-local`.
2. `RedisServer` scan — `RedisKey[] keys; … keys = Rent(count); … new ScanResult(cursor,
   keys, count, true)` (the `ScanResult` owns the `Return` via `Recycle()`, called by
   `CursorEnumerable` — confirmed in source). The **bare-LOCAL assignment rent** was
   mis-classified as a field rent by the syntactic POOL001 pass (`FieldName` is purely
   syntactic) and flagged with no escape analysis. **Fix:** gate that pass's assignment
   arm on `model.GetSymbolInfo(asg.Left).Symbol is IFieldSymbol` — a bare-local
   assignment rent belongs to the flow pass (which does escape analysis but does not
   track the assignment form), so it is honestly untracked rather than flagged unsoundly.

Both verified end to end: live Redis oracle re-runs took own-only 10 → 9 → 6, all
pooled-buffer findings cleared; CI golden + corpus-benchmark green. The remaining 6
Redis own-only are real or honest warnings — the `sentinelPrimaryReconnectTimer` /
`_inputCancel` / `_outputCancel` undisposed `Timer`/`CTS` fields (benign true positives,
like serilog's `_shutdownSignal`), the two `connection.Connection*` injected-source
subscriptions (warning tier — unknown lifetime), and the `toys/` sample host — none FPs.

## Rejected approaches

### Static-class subscriber exemption (the CsvHelper `ConsoleHost` over-reach)

**Attempted in PR #157, reverted in `488d505` before merge. Do not retry.**

To clear the two CsvHelper `ConsoleHost` FPs (§3, root-cause 3 — a process-lived
host subscribing to a process-lived `AppDomain`/`Console` event), the tempting move
was to add `|| clsIsStatic` next to the existing `clsIsApp` exemption in the
extractor (`Program.cs`, the `if (!isTimer && source == "static" && clsIsApp)`
drop): "the subscriber's containing type is a `static class`, so there's no instance
to leak — drop the OWN014 the same way we drop it for the WPF `App` singleton."

**Why it is unsound.** A `static class` only rules out an instance `this` being
pinned. It says **nothing** about a lambda handler that captures a **local**. When
the source is a static/process-lived event, that captured local is pinned for the
whole process — a genuine leak. The exemption would silently swallow it:

```csharp
static class Foo {
    void Attach(VM vm) =>
        SystemEvents.UserPreferenceChanged += (_, _) => vm.Refresh(); // pins vm forever
}
```

`clsIsApp` is safe where `clsIsStatic` is not: the WPF `App` singleton *is* the
process-lived object, so promoting its own subscriptions to process lifetime changes
nothing; a static class is just a namespace for methods whose lambdas can still
capture and pin arbitrary shorter-lived state.

**Caught by:** Codex (P2) and CodeRabbit (Major) in review of #157, before merge.

**Why a sound narrowing still wouldn't help here.** A capture-gated version
("exempt only when the handler captures nothing") would be sound — but it would
**not** clear the motivating case: CsvHelper's `ConsoleHost` handlers capture `cts`
and `resetEvent`, so the capture-free guard would (correctly) keep firing. The clear
verdict is "this specific host is process-lived" (the subscriber's own lifetime),
which we have no reliable signal for. So those two findings stay in
`corpus/oracle-fp-baseline.txt` as baselined FPs rather than being suppressed by an
extractor rule. An in-code `ANTI-PATTERN` comment at the exemption site warns against
re-adding `|| clsIsStatic`.

## How the baseline stays honest

- **Matched by name, not line** — `(repo, file-basename, OWN code,
  message-substring)`. Re-runs clone the target at HEAD and line numbers drift;
  the field/event/local name in the message does not.
- **Suppresses only confirmed FPs.** True positives (serilog CTS; NLog benign
  field leaks) are never baselined — they remain the visible proof the niche
  works.
- **Self-retiring.** Each entry names the fix that obsoletes it. When that lands,
  delete the line; if the FP was real after all, the oracle re-surfaces it.
- **Verified in CI.** `oracle_compare.py --selftest` covers the baseline
  loader, the name-not-line match key, repo scoping, the `*` wildcard, the
  render, and the `unittest` path rule.
